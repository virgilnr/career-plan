What happened right now is that i really confused on what i want to learn. There are so many fields that i want to take grasp of. Those are :
1. Able to do Data Science
2. I want to be a Linux Power Users
3. Understanding fullstack programming
4. Yet, on the verge of wanting to build system and web dev at the same time
5. Could speak Chinese
