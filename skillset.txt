What happened right now is that i really confused on what i want to learn. There are so many fields that i want to take grasp of. Those are :
- I want to be a Linux Power Users
- Understanding fullstack programming
- Understanding networking and sys admin
- Could speak Chinese
- Well, i guess for now i'll make use of git and github!
